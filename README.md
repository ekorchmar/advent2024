# Advent of code 2024

All solutions are written in Python, with the restriction that only a single line is allowed for each solution.

This makes it impossible to use imports, classes, multiline function definitions, exceptions etc. Using `eval` would be
cheating, so I will not use that either.

Only exception to this rule is using `import sys` to increase the recursion limit, as some problems require deep recursion.

I wish I could remember the author of this idea, but I can not find the source. It was a post on Bluesky. If you know
the author, please let me know so I can give them proper credit.
